      <h1>About Me</h1>
    
      <p>Welcome to my about me page! </p>
      <p> My name is Jacob Dauphinais, and 
      I have been interested in programming, developing, and computer science ever since I was young.
      Being in the CSC106 The Joy of Programming Class is really exciting, 
      as I get to learn more about languages I don't know! Working with others on coding projects
      has been a dream of mine, so doing it in this class will be very exciting. I also played tennis 
      my freshman through junior year of high school, and our team won the State Championship during my sophmore year!</p>
